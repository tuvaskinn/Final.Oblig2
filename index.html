        <p>This summer I spent many hours on both my own and other friends’ boats. Some of my favorite memories
            is from the boat days with my friends, like this one. This picture is from the southernmost point of
            Norway, Lindesnes! We were 15 people on my friend’s cabin, enjoying long days out on the ocean.</p>

        <div class="btext2"><h3>  Long, sunny boatdays</h3></div>
        <p>On the few days I had off from work this summer, this is what I did. My friend would pick me up with
            his boat on my cabin, and we would take the boat out to this calm bay and lay there for hours, just
            sunbathing, listening to the waves, and talking. The perfect relaxation before more days of work. </p>

        <p>Another one of my favorite summer activities is watersports! Especially waterskiing and wakeboarding,
            coming from a skiing background. Me and my friends spend hours trying to master new tricks on the
            waterskies and wakeboard, and we don’t give up until we have nailed it!</p>

        <p>The last weeks of the summer was spent moving to the city with my best friend. Being in a new city,
            we spent many days exploring the different parts of the city that we had never been in. These weeks
            had the most beautiful weather, showing off the city from its best side.</p>

        <p>A traditional thing to eat at the Norwegian south coast is shrimp. People often invite friends over
            to eat fresh shrimp that you peel yourself, served with white bread, mayonnaise and lemon.
            This picture is from one of the shrimp nights I had this summer.</p>
