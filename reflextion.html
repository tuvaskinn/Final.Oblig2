    <h2> translation from wireframe to webpage</h2>
    <p class="reflection">
        The first part of this assignment was to create a wireframe, to plan what we wanted the page to look like.
        We had a clear vision on how we wanted it. We wanted a navigation bar at the top, where the left side
        linked to the images further down on the page, and the right side opened new pages with the reflection
        and the wireframes. In the middle of these we wanted the main heading of the page. We also wanted all
        of this on top of a picture.
        <br><br>
        We had no issues creating all the links and the heading. The difficult part was to put it on top of
        the picture. After trying different things, using the background-img property in CSS worked the best.
        <br><br>
        After this was to create the part with the photos. First I coded in the images in a regular way, but
        couldn’t figure out how to put the text on top of the image. I tried many different ways and finding
        different codes in forums but nothing worked. After removing all my code and starting over I figured it
        out. Putting the text and the image together in a div, and putting the position of the image to relative
        and the text to absolute it worked. After this everything else was easy to figure out.

    <h2>Compatibility for small and large screens</h2>
    <p class="reflection">
        The main challenge we had when implementing the page was that it was difficult to get some o the
        «design accepts» to work on a mobile phone screen. When viewing the website on a computer everything
        looked fine. Most of the elements translated well over to another screen size, however we struggled
        with some of the pictures and text. It was very challenging to find the root of the problem and still
        keep the webpage looking the same. We started from scratch, tried different codes, deleted elements
        etc… Nothing worked as we wanted.
        <br><br>
        The last thing we tried was removing the width of the p element, because we found out that the div could not
        become smaller than the p element. This worked, and now everything works as it should on smaller screens.
    </p>

    <h2>Using the < picture > element</h2>
    <p class="reflection">
    <p class="reflection">
        To be honest, we used the picture element because the assignment said we should use it. But after tying it
        we understood why it is recommended. When shrinking the screen size, the pictures moved with the screen
        perfectly.
